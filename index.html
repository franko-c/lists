        <h2>Unordered Lists</h2>
        <!-- Heading for the main content -->
        <h3>My favourite things to eat</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>White Chocolate <em>and</em> Raspberry Cookies</li>
            <li>Every cereal ever to exist <strong>except</strong> the ones with raisins in 'em. I love grapes, but raisins...</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I'm not sure if it's customary to write an aside under a list item like this - and I haven't checked yet - cause you know what? Raisins are wild...for real! Why do that to a grape? Why put a juicy, crisp, refreshing delicacy through such a torturous process, only to achieve an objectively inferior snack...?</li>
                  </ul>
            <li>Beef Quarter Pounders, baby! And some brioche buns. And some cheese...</li>
            <li>Pastries - I'm talkin' croissants, pain au chocolat, chocolate twists!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Countries I'd like to cycle in</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>France</li>
            <li>Spain</li>
            <li>Colombia</li>
            <li>Italy</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ordered Lists</h2>
        <h3>Things I <em>should</em> do today</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Get to 50% completion on 'Foundations'</li>
            <li>Do at least 1 hour on the indoor trainer</li>
            <li>Have a shower!</li>
            <li>Do my laundry...using that fancy new CHAPT3 laundry detergent...</li>
            <li>Sit on the toilet and let out the most robust, most enormous, girthiest poop of my life!</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>My favourite video games or movies</h3>
        <p>This is only an ordered list because the assignment requires it to be. Really, they're listed in no particular order.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Rocket League</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This game has given me so much, but also, it hasn't done a damn thing for me! All those hours, wasted...</li>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Cars</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>How about that soundtrack? Okay, I only really like one song...but it makes the whole movie a thousand times better!</li>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Miami Vice</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I don't have a great reason for putting this on here. Joaquin Phoenix stars in it, though, I couldn't tell you much about it. I think that's what the director was going for though. What do you mean I'm in denial?!</li>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Arrival</strong></li>
            <li><strong>The Matrix Reloaded</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Neo and his newfound abilities are in their honeymoon phase during the second installment of The Matrix trilogy and I feel like the Wachowski Sisters made the most of it. Action overload!</li>
                </ul>
        </ol>
